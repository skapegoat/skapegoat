### Hi! I'm Reiko, a QA Engineer working at Luizalabs! =)


- 🔭 My name is Ana Tavares, but everyone calls me Reiko.
- 🌍 My mother language is Brazillian Portuguese. I can also speak English very well. I can comunicate in Japanese and I'm studying Thai right now. Should be trying Chinese pretty soon. 
- 🌱 I've been developing automation and manual tests to help improving quality to Luizalabs' systems, preventing bugs since march 2022! 
- 👀 My favorite tool at the moment is Cypress, but I'm also studying Webdriver for future projects.
- 🧩 I work well with javascript, but I do know a bit of python and Java. Also open to learn new languages if needed.
- 🕹️ In the past, I've developed a few tiny RPG and action games with Construct2 and Unity.
